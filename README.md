# numeric_converter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The program is able to calculate expressions consisting of numbers on different bases. Let's consider the following example:

0x11+0b1010+7+0o22, the answer should be 52

This expression contains numbers in 4 bases:
-    0x11 - hexadecimal
-    0b1010 - binary
-    7 - decimal
-    0o22 - octal

You can differentiate bases using x, b, o in your expression.

You can also use operations like "plus" or "minus".
